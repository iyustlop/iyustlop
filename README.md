# Hi, I'm Nacho Yuste

I am a Telecommunications Engineer with over 20 years of experience in the software industry. Throughout my career, I have been deeply involved in software development projects across various sectors, consistently delivering high-quality and efficient solutions. My technical background and extensive experience have enabled me to become highly proficient in programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, including expertise in their major frameworks and ecosystemsâ€”such as Spring Boot for Java, Django and Flask for Python, and React, Node.js, and Vue.js for JavaScript.

Since 2024, I have been actively expanding my professional skill set by pursuing advanced training in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. This includes a solid foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. I have worked with and studied the most widely used frameworks and libraries in the field, such as:

* Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization
* Scikit-learn for machine learning models and pipelines
* TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras for deep learning and neural networks
* XGBoost and LightGBM for gradient boosting and structured data modeling
* LangChain and Hugging Face Transformers for building and deploying applications based on large language models (LLMs)
* MLflow and Weights & Biases for experiment tracking and model lifecycle management
* Apache Spark and Dask for scalable data processing

My combined background in software engineering and my recent focus on data science and AI place me in a unique position to contribute to innovative, intelligent software systems that are both robust and scalable.
